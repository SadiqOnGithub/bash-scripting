# docAndDocxSort
	don't forget to change permission before running
	`chmod +x docAndDocxSort.sh`

-to convert docx to pdf we are using -- unoconv -- as it is simple. 
	and the command to convert doc to pdf is `unoconv -f pdf /path/to/document.docx`
	
-libreoffice and soffice are producing corrupt pdf.
-pandoc is taking all the packages of the universe to run.

docAndDocxSort is working fine. Done. Alhamdulillah.
